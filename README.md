So I am finally getting started on this assignment. I have spent the last two days catching up on work that had been graded and needed some tweaking.

I have the HTML and CSS entered to make my page look like the mockup. I know that I will have to go back and change those as I get the JS done...I just wanted to do the easy part first.

I will be starting the JS now, and we are supposed to use jQuery. I am still uncomfortable with it, but then again that's the point of the assignment...to become more familiar with it. I will let you know how that went later.
