So I am finally getting started on this assignment. I have spent the last two days catching up on work that had been graded and needed some tweaking.

I have the HTML and CSS entered to make my page look like the mockup. I know that I will have to go back and change those as I get the JS done...I just wanted to do the easy part first.

I will be starting the JS now, and we are supposed to use jQuery. I am still uncomfortable with it, but then again that's the point of the assignment...to become more familiar with it. I will let you know how that went later.

So it's been a few days and I finally completed the project. The most hilarious thing that happened on this assignment: I didn't link my jQuery in my HTML. And by hilarious I mean I was so irritated I wanted to throw my computer out the window. I could not figure out why my JavaScript wasn't working. Finally a classmate looked at my code and saw that the link was missing. So that's a mistake I won't make again.

Here is the link to my gh-pages for this project:
